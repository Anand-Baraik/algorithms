"""
Given an array of integers,
return a new array such that each element at index i of the new
array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24].
If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].
